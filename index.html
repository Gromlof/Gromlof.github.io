                    <p> 
                        I am a programmer who is learning mostly on codecademy.
                        My first experience in programming was when I started to learn how to make videos-games back in
                        2019.
                        I found a formation to learn C# and Unity. I passed the formation obtained my <a>certificate<a>
                                and build some <a>project<a> along the way.
                                        Then started to get interested into web-dev but not only.
                                        <br> Here is a not exhaustive list of topics that catch my interest in the past
                                        years:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Block-chain</li>
                        <li>Cryptocurrencies / trading strategies</li>
                        <li>Deep-learning /AI</li>
                        <li>Web3 technologies</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        At the moment I need to pick either C# and ASP.NET,<br>Python and all the courses that com with
                        it
                        on codecademy <br>or javascript and some frameworks.
                        <br>I already have a good understanding of C# so It probably make the more sense and would also
                        be
                        the safest bet to find a job because I have plenty of idea to build a strong portfolio.
                        On the other hand python as more application in the fields of interests I listed above.
                        And finally javascript is the one making more sens to keep on the web-dev path simply because it
                        has a crasy amount of application in that field, but out-side of that it falls behind the two
                        others.
